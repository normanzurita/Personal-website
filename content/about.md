Manufacturing

At Acme Corporation, we take pride in what we create. Our manufacturing process goes through 3 different stages of fine workmanship to give you the best possible shapes.


1) Drawing - Our shapes are drawn with precision to 1/100 of a millimeter.
   * We use advanced vector drawing tools to create our catalog.
   * Quality checking happens hundreds of times for each shape we create.
     * We have high-quality bots that inspect our output.
     * There is also a manual team inspecting each product.
     * All our bugs are turned into automated checks that bots perform in every future shape.
   * We round all corners and clean up properly.
2) Rasterizing - Our raster engine is world-class and keeps the vector right until it gets to our high-quality laser printers.
3) Delivery - Our output is hosted on the fastest of CDN with a 99.99% uptime and the bandwidth that can take care of all your load.
