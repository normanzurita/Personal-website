The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:
The rake face; and The flank. The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &amp;ldquo;Œ±&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Our Manufacturing Process Part III</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-3/</guid><description>Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &amp;ldquo;cutting speed&amp;rdquo; and a secondary motion called &amp;ldquo;feed&amp;rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</description></item><item><title>Our Manufacturing Process Part II</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-2/</guid><description>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</description></item><item><title>Our Manufacturing Process Part I</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/process-1/</guid><description>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/contact/</guid><description>Contact Us Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I am in the second paragraph.
I am the third one. Even though there are two line breaks before me, this does not create any newline characters. After me there are two spaces before the newline character.

It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ‚óª ABCD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Circle</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/community/circle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/community/circle/</guid><description>&lt;p>A circle is a simple closed shape. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Curve</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/community/curve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/blog/community/curve/</guid><description>&lt;p>In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but that need not be straight.

Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse.</description></item><item><title>Square License</title><link>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/news/square-license/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (Acme Corporation)</author><guid>https://normanzurita.github.io/hugo-in-action-chap-2/news/square-license/</guid><description>A license (American English) or licence (British English) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).
